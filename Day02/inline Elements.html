    <!--In HTML, inline elements are those that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are used to style parts of the text and are included as a part of the main text 1234. 
        
    Some examples of inline elements are:-
     <a>, <span>, <img>, <code>, <cite>, <button>, and <input> 3.

In contrast, block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available 1234. They are used to define larger sections of content and are often used as containers for other HTML elements 1234. Some examples of block-level elements are <p>, <div>, <h1>, <figure>, and <form> 1-->
