    <h2>MERAJ</h2><!--Heading element is a block elements In HTML, 
        
        every element has a default display value, which can be either **block** or **inline** . Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available . They are commonly used for larger structures such as paragraphs and sections, and include elements such as `<p>` and `<div>` . Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary . They are commonly used for smaller structures such as text and include elements such as `<a>` and `<span>` . 

        Here is a list of some common block-level elements in HTML :
        
        - `<address>`
        - `<article>`
        - `<aside>`
        - `<blockquote>`
        - `<canvas>`
        - `<dd>`
        - `<div>`
        - `<dl>`
        - `<dt>`
        - `<fieldset>`
        - `<figcaption>`
        - `<figure>`
        - `<footer>`
        - `<form>`
        - `<h1>` to `<h6>`
        - `<header>`
        - `<hr>`
        - `<li>`
        - `<main>`
